- bug: when calling setFoo or setFooUntil on bitemporal objects, if the value of foo is the same, no change is made, even if the end date of the operation
    (via copyDetachedValueUntil, or setFooUntil) would change the timeline.
- philosphy doc: 
    - stored procs: transaction management becomes very hard when stored procs are doing begin/commit/rollback
    - maybe talk about leaky abstractions more. no native queries. no "if your database supports..."
- query subsetting
    - a small shape hash table that's checked linearly.
        - add a shapeHashCode, shapeEquals methods to Operation
        - add a isSubsetOperation, getSuperSetOperationFromShape(shapeOp), getLeftOverOperation(shapeOp) (or maybe Pair the last two) methods to Operation
        - the hash will contain up to N (10?) shapes that are currently cached.
            - shape prevents deep fetch queries from overwhelming the table, because they all have the same shape
- support for object xml for more vendors
- done: list relationship navigation and deep fetching should work better
- build doesn't seem to work in git-bash on windows
- pool flushing when several connections fails
- done: meta util. There are several places where we're using the meta data to do things. Should consolidate.
- merge api
